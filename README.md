# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the new analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results:
* First, we are looking for employees who were born between 1952-01-01 and 1955-12-31 because they're the qualified employees to participate the program.

* Second, we notice that there are a few employees have more than one title during their careers, and some employees have already retired as well. As result, what we should do is filter the current employees who born in specific range with current titles.

* Third, we want to know how many employees are retiring in the company for each recent job title, there are a lot!

* Fourth, we use the same skills above to create another table to illustrate mentorship eligibility for employees who born in 1965, not so close to retire which means they have time to teach new employees.<img width="840" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 10 53 11 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88211298/135506206-7dda735e-4776-4895-a332-b3de9630d1ae.png">

## Summary:
For the first question, I select the birth_date <='1965-12-31' to see how many employees need to be filled as the "silver tsunami". From the table, we can see there are a lot of senior engineers and staffs are ready to retire, the other roles are engineer, staff, technique leader, assistant engineer and manager.<img width="979" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-30 at 11 57 29 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88211298/135514551-bb4cba75-0746-451c-bb7e-e05f2ff0193a.png">

For the second question, we need to know how many employees in the mentorship program for each title. Compare to the table above, I cannot say enough staffs and engineers to cover the retiring employees because it depends on many situations, such as whether the retirement-ready-employees like to be mentors, what's the standard to be mentors, or how many new employees will be hired in the company.
